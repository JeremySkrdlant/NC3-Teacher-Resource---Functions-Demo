# NC3 Instructor Resource for Functions Demo

This lesson goes over the structures of a function in the Swift Language.  It has a review at the beginning and then a few challenges for students to do.  They will be implementing their function 
declarations in a protocol so they will not have to worry about implementing the entire function getting it to work.
